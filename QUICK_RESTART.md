   - Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal where server is running

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 3. Done! ✅

That's it! The errors are already fixed, you just need to restart the server.

## Why?
Next.js caches compiled code. After fixing Prisma and clearing `.next` folder, the server needs to recompile with the new code.
