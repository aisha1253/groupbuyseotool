GroupBuy Tools - Digital Marketplace Platform
A next-generation marketplace platform where buyers and sellers can trade digital tools (SEO tools, streaming accounts, AI tools, course accounts, etc.) with stunning 3D UI, AI-powered features, built-in chat ratings, and invoice management.

Problem Statement
Currently, people sell digital tools through fragmented channels like Facebook groups and WhatsApp, leading to:

Trust Issues: High prevalence of scams and fake sellers
Price Opacity: No centralized price comparison
No Accountability: Lack of ratings and review systems
Poor User Experience: Scattered across multiple platforms
This platform consolidates the marketplace, establishes trust through verified ratings, enables price transparency, and provides an immersive, modern user experience.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Technology Stack Decision

Based on research, I recommend Prisma + PostgreSQL over MongoDB or Firebase for the following reasons:

Type Safety: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types
Complex Relationships: Better handling of buyer-seller-product-order relationships
Transaction Support: Strong ACID compliance
Migration Management: Version-controlled schema changes
Cost Effective: Free tier available (Vercel Postgres, Supabase, Neon)
IMPORTANT

Modern 3D Design

This platform will feature stunning, premium 3D animations and glassmorphism using Framer Motion, React Three Fiber, and advanced CSS effects to create a WOW factor that stands out from competitors.

WARNING

Payment Integration Scope

Initial implementation creates payment infrastructure without actual processing. Supports:

Manual payment links (sellers add their own URLs)
Invoice generation
Order tracking
Future: Stripe/PayPal integration
